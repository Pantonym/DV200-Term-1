# About this project

## Project Description
This project aimed to create a website that displays data from an api through Charts.js. The project uses a cryptocurrency API to do this.

## Built With
This project was built with React.js, CSS and Charts.js

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
You will require the installations of:
* axios
* react-router-dom
* bootstrap react-bootstrap
* react-chartjs-2 chart.js
You will also require VisualStudioCode, or an equivalent.

## How to install
1. Click on Terminal and open a new terminal
2. Type the following:
3. npm i axios
4. npm i react-router-dom
5. npm i bootstrap react-bootstrap
6. npm i react-chartjs-2 chart.js

# Features and Functionality
Each graph on the compare and timeline pages can be edited by choosing which currencies you want to display. The landing page features a  description of the project, as well as a dashboard with information on the recent top coins in the market. A more detailed description of Bitcoin is also available on this page.

# Development Process
* Implementation Process
  * Highlights
    * Some highlights are the implementation of functionality to the graphs. It was very interesting to create code that automatically populates html tags with large amounts of data, as well as automatically assigning unique values to them for the higher functionality.
  * Challenges
    * A major challenge was perspective. It was quite hard to visualize what the new code was going to do, especially the code that  automatically populates and creates html tags. Another problem was asynchronous code, such as the code that sets universal values.  Different methods of forcing the code to wait was created to ensure all the data loads.

# Future Implementation
In the future, more precise data would be added, such as data form CoinGecko. More detail would also be given to the UI of the website to  ensure it is of the highest quality. 

# Final Outcome

# Conclusion
In conclusion, I have created a website that acts as a dashboard for data from an API, which is displayed through charts created through Charts.js. I have learned how to create and use a react application, as well as how to implement and style charts with charts.js. I have also used Bootstrap inside of react for greater styling.
